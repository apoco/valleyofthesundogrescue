<p>
  We are always accepting new volunteers into our organization. We have many
  tasks and events that require the kind help of a volunteer. Each volunteer is
  required to fill out and sign a volunteer contract.

</p>
<p>
  We need volunteers to help at our weekly adoption events. During the adoption
  events you as a volunteer would be needed to talk with prospective adopters
  about our dogs, set up the adoptions event at the beginning of the day and
  take down the event at the end of the day, clean up any potty accidents,
  ensure each dog has a blanket and water, walk the dogs and much more. 
</p>
<p>
  Valley of the Sun Dog Rescue needs volunteers to transport dogs. Our dogs
  need transport to and from adoption events and veterinary clinics.
</p>
<p>
  Volunteering at adoption events and transporting are just a few of the ways
  you can volunteer for our organization. We also need dog walkers in east 
  mesa, volunteers to work obedience, etc. For more information call Kathy @@
  480-228-0126 or

<h3>Foster</h3>
<p>
  Valley of the Sun Dog Rescue is ALWAYS in need of foster parents! The more
  foster homes we have the more dogs that we can rescue. We do not have a 
  facility (although we are working towards that goal). As we do not have a 
  facility we solely rely on foster parents to home our rescue dogs. This 
  serves as a great advantage to each dog that we rescue. As a foster parent we
  ask that you work on basic skills the dog will need to help it find a new 
  forever home. These skills include house training, crate training, leash 
  training and socialization. In addition to those basic skills if our foster 
  parents are able to teach basic obedience and more we are very thankful! The 
  foster parent of an adoptable dog should also be able to provide transport to
  our adoption events each weekend.
</p>
<p>
  We are also always in need for foster parents willing to care for our special
  needs dogs. We may have a pregnant or nursing mother dog in need of a foster
  home or a litter of puppies that require bottle feedings. We also rescue
  injured animals that need a foster home to heal until they are ready to go up
  for adoption and find their forever home.
</p>
<p>
  Most of all what is needed to be a great foster is to provide LOVE! We can 
  provide a crate, collar and crate if needed. If needed we can also provide 
  dog food. 
</p>
