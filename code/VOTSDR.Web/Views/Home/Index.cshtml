<div id="about">
    <p>
      Valley of the Sun Dog Rescue is a no-kill animal shelter and has been a 
      registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization since the year 2000. <b>We specialize
      in American Pitbulls and American Staffordshire Terriers, but we accept all
      breeds into our rescue.</b> 
    </p>
    <p>
      We are headquartered and operated from our home. We are a family run 
      organization with the help of foster care providers and volunteers. With this 
      great working staff we rescue all breeds of dogs that are ill, injured, 
      maimed, abandoned or simply unwanted. Our dogs are obtained from the various 
      animal shelters in the area, as well as those animals given up by private 
      citizens.

              <h3>Our Adoption Process</h3>
              <p>
                We hold adoption clinics weekly at various PetSmart pet centers in the 
                area. Although we specialize in American Pitbull and American 
                Staffordshire Terriers, all dog breeds in need are accepted with open 
                arms, treated and evaluated as necessary and adopted to private homes. 
                Our prospective adopters are required to fill out an in depth adoption 
                contract, submit to home checks for a period of one year, as well as pay 
                an adoption fee for the animal. Additionally, there are monetary 
                penalties that must be agreed to for any mistreatment of the adopted 
                animal. We also reserve the right to reclaim the animal in the event of 
                mistreatment. Further, we reserve the right to pursue any individuals for
                mistreatment or neglect of the adopted animal through the court system or
                law enforcement agencies. All of the above must be read, intialed and the
                entire document signed frior to any adoption. We also have additional and
                specific requirements of the prospective adopters and their families to 
                adopt a “bully” breed that must be met.
              </p>

              <h3>Our Mission Statement</h3>
              <p>
                Our mission is to rescue abandoned, injured or abused dogs, 
                rehabilitate them, have them vaccinated, spay or neutered and help them
                find their forever home.  We also strive to increase public awareness
                about the gentler, humane side of a "Bully" breed.
